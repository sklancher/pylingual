DOCUMENTATION = '\n---\nmodule: win_audit_rule\nshort_description: Adds an audit rule to files, folders, or registry keys\ndescription:\n  - Used to apply audit rules to files, folders or registry keys.\n  - Once applied, it will begin recording the user who performed the operation defined into the Security\n    Log in the Event viewer.\n  - The behavior is designed to ignore inherited rules since those cannot be adjusted without first disabling\n    the inheritance behavior. It will still print inherited rules in the output though for debugging purposes.\noptions:\n  path:\n    description:\n      - Path to the file, folder, or registry key.\n      - Registry paths should be in Powershell format, beginning with an abbreviation for the root\n        such as, C(HKLM:\\Software).\n    type: path\n    required: yes\n    aliases: [ dest, destination ]\n  user:\n    description:\n      - The user or group to adjust rules for.\n    type: str\n    required: yes\n  rights:\n    description:\n      - Comma separated list of the rights desired. Only required for adding a rule.\n      - If I(path) is a file or directory, rights can be any right under MSDN\n        FileSystemRights U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.filesystemrights.aspx).\n      - If I(path) is a registry key, rights can be any right under MSDN\n        RegistryRights U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.registryrights.aspx).\n    type: list\n    elements: str\n    required: yes\n  inheritance_flags:\n    description:\n      - Defines what objects inside of a folder or registry key will inherit the settings.\n      - If you are setting a rule on a file, this value has to be changed to C(none).\n      - For more information on the choices see MSDN PropagationFlags enumeration\n        at U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.inheritanceflags.aspx).\n    type: list\n    elements: str\n    choices: [ ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit ]\n    default: ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit\n  propagation_flags:\n    description:\n      - Propagation flag on the audit rules.\n      - This value is ignored when the path type is a file.\n      - For more information on the choices see MSDN PropagationFlags enumeration\n        at U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.propagationflags.aspx).\n    choices: [ None, InherityOnly, NoPropagateInherit ]\n    default: "None"\n  audit_flags:\n    description:\n      - Defines whether to log on failure, success, or both.\n      - To log both define as comma separated list "Success, Failure".\n    type: list\n    elements: str\n    required: yes\n    choices: [ Failure, Success ]\n  state:\n    description:\n      - Whether the rule should be C(present) or C(absent).\n      - For absent, only I(path), I(user), and I(state) are required.\n      - Specifying C(absent) will remove all rules matching the defined I(user).\n    type: str\n    choices: [ absent, present ]\n    default: present\nseealso:\n- module: community.windows.win_audit_policy_system\nauthor:\n  - Noah Sparks (@nwsparks)\n'
